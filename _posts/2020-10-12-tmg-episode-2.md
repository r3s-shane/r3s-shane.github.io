## Podcast Summary

<p class="intro">In this episode of Tuesday Morning Grind, we discuss risk3sixty's approach to helping startups and high growth technology companies implement information security programs.</p>

Security Program Lifecycle Management can seem daunting, especially when viewed through the lens of a massive framework like ISO 27001 or NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

But if you zoom out, implementing and managing an Information Security Program can be broken down into four high-level phases that can be repeated as needed within any organization. 


## The Information Security Program Lifecycle
<dl>
  <dt>Step 1: Scoping and Context</dt>
  <dd>The context of the organization and scope of the information security program need to be re-scope continually. Internal audits and risk assessments should be used to identify changes in the organization that would impact the scope and context of the program.</dd>
  
  <dt>Step 2: Gap and Current State Assessment</dt>
  <dd>With the scope and context of the security program established, the organization should choose an appropriate framework to align to and perform a current state assessment (or gap assessment). The goal is to identify process and control gaps.</dd>
  
  <dt>Step 3: Risk Assessment</dt>
  <dd>Risk Assessment activities consist of the body of work that helps the organization to monitor and identify risks to the security of the organization's assets. Beyond a formal Risk Assessment, it may also include inputs from Business Impact Analysis (BIA), Penetration Tests, Vendor Risk Assessments, and more.</dd>
  
  <dt>Step 4: Information Security Program Cadence</dt>
  <dd>Information Security program cadence consists of both the periodic meetings and re-occurring control activities required to ensure that information security does not become siloed, and critical governance functions and controls are operating effectively.</dd>
